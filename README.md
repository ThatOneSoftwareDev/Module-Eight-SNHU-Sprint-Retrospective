This is a project for my SNHU FInal

# üìò Reflection
## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating ‚Äúuser stories‚Äù help with this?
I figure out what users want by reading the project goals or asking questions. Making user stories helps me understand what features to build and why they matter.

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I like to break the work into smaller parts and finish a bit at a time. I hope to keep using sprints and daily check-ins so I stay on track.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
It means helping out, being respectful, and finishing your part on time. Also, listening during meetings and giving feedback when needed.
